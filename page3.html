                        Noah Holt has spent years dreaming of vengeance for the death of his father, but when faced with his killer, he learns a daunting truth <span id="nEvils-dots">...</span> <span id="nEvils-more">
                        he can&apos;t escape. His father was a monster.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Unable to ignore his own surfacing memories, Noah embarks on a quest to find the truth about his childhood with the help of an unlikely ally: the very person who murdered his father. Since their confrontation, Adam is obsessed with Noah, and he wants to help him uncover the answers he seeks, however dark they may be.
                        
                    <br><br>
                        The two share a mutual attraction, but deep down, Noah knows Adam&apos;s not like other boys. Adam can&apos;t love. He wasn&apos;t born that way. But he refuses to let Noah go, and Noah&apos;s not sure he wants him to.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Can Adam prove to Noah that passion, power, and protection are just as good as love?<br><br>
